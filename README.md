## Motivation ##
Productivity seems to be the defining word of many apps in the last few years.

The Custom File Manager embodies this ideology, by allowing its user to have full 
control over which files they want to add in order to access them easily later.

## Using the program ##
There are four tabs on which you can add and group files/folders:
* Games
* Apps
* Documents
* Folders

You can add a file/folder by selecting it after pressing the "+" button. 
To access it, simply click on the button that appears afterwards.

You can also choose to sort the added files/folders by:
* Name (default)
* Last accessed date
* Number of clicks
* Size

In the Settings Window, you have the option to enable the app to open
automatically at start-up. 

Also, you have the option to choose between two themes: Dark (default) 
and Light. Changes apply once exiting the Settings Window.
